The Bank Management System is a robust application built using Advanced C++, incorporating OOP principles (abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, modularity) and adhering to the SOLID design for scalability. It features seven interactive screens for managing clients, including adding, deleting, updating, and searching for clients, along with a transaction screen for deposits and withdrawals. The system ensures secure operations using bitwise permission handling, input validation, and file operations for data persistence, optimizing performance while maintaining a user-friendly experience.
